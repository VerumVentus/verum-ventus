    <h1>Data Collection</h1>
    <h2>We mined the internet for fake news data.</h2>
    <p>
      After defining the goal of this project, we now move on to the next step:
      data collection. <span class="highlighted">Data collection</span> is the
      process of gathering relevant information that will help us answer the
      research questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our mission to tackle the issue of misinformation, we have developed a
      custom Twitter scraper tool that allows us to gather tweet and user data
      from the platform. Twitter, being a prominent social media platform,
      serves as a rich source of information and conversations surrounding our
      topic.
    </p>
    <div class="my-8">
      <Box
        class="text-center max-w-none bg-[#16191c]"
        header="Keywords"
        icon="hi-key"
      >
        <p>
          We used the following keywords to search for tweets that are relevant
          to our topic:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span v-for="keyword in keywords" class="badge">
            {{ keyword }}
          </span>
        </p>
      </Box>
    </div>
    <h2>Data Scraper</h2>

    <p>
      The following Python script collected the tweets with specified keywords,
      streamlining the data collection process and saving time. Automating the
      collection ensures a comprehensive dataset for analysis, enabling
      efficient capture of a large volume of essential tweets for model training
      and investigations.

    <h2>Criteria</h2>
    <p>
      In order to ensure high quality data, achieve accurate modeling, and
      produce reliable results, the selection of tweets for our dataset is
      guided by the following criteria:
    </p>
    <div class="grid grid-rows-3 gap-8">
      <Card
        class="max-w-none"
        v-for="criterion in criteria"
        :header="criterion.header"
        :msg="criterion.content"
        :icon="criterion.icon"
      />
    </div>
    <p>The following factors were also taken into consideration:</p>
    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
      <Card
        class="max-w-none text-center"
        v-for="type in types"
        :header="type.name"
        :msg="type.description"
        :icon="type.icon"
      />
    </div>

    <router-link to="/results" class="flex items-center gap-4 mt-8 group">
      <p>
        <span class="highlighted group-hover:text-primary"
          >Next chapter: Exploring the Data</span
        >
      </p>

      <v-icon
        name="hi-arrow-right"
        class="transform transition-all group-hover:translate-x-3"
      />
    </router-link>
